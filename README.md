# Hate Crime Analysis

The purpose of this project was to chase our passion for a safe haven and use AI (our brains) 
to predict higher crime locations.

We researched the following questions:
  1. Do we see a trend in crime rate?

    Crime rates increase over the years. 
    
    
  2. Can we predict safer months?

    Safe months appear to be from December to January. Unsafe months appear to be June to August.
    
  3. Does unemployment raise crime?

    2017 shows high crime count BUT lower unemployment rate, which was surprising. 
  
  4. Do we hire more police officers to combat crime?

    2017 shows a drastic descrease in police force inspite of a crime rate increase. 
 
  5. CA has a higher crime rate than NY and Ohio. Can we say the same thing for the major cities within 
  these states?

    California tops in crime count but the same is not true for LA (major ciry within CA) 
    as compared to NY city. 
 
 
  6. Where do most crimes occur? How should police plan their patrol locations?

    Residential areas clearly stand out and need more police patrolling.
